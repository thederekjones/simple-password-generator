# Overview

The goal of this project was to create a random password generator with letters, numbers, 
and symbols based on input provided by the user. PyPassword will take the input provided 
by the user, and randomly generate a password with the specified length.

While I know that there are methods and easier ways to do this, I wanted to create the for 
loops to show that I understand what is happening behind the scenes.

### The game starts by running the following command:
```
python3 password_generator.py
```
or
```
./password_generator.py
```

### You must have Python 3 installed. Download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
